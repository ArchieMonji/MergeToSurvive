	"IN ADDITION, CAN HAVE AN EVENT BE TRIGGERED ON CLOSE (SO STUFF CAN HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A DIALOGUE SCENE).",
	"FOR ESPECIALLY LONG LINES SUCH AS THE ONE YOU ARE READING NOW, ALL TEXT MAY NOT FIT IN THE DIALOGUE BOX. THIS IS OK BECAUSE THIS BOX HAS SCROLL BARS WHICH WILL ALLOW THE USER TO VIEW PREVIOUS TEXT. THERE IS NO RISK OF MISSING OUT ON THE NARRATIVE! WRITERS CAN NOW WRITE REALLY LONG DIALOGUE LINES IN THE SCRIPT IF THEY SO CHOOSE. HOPE YOU LIKE LORE!",
